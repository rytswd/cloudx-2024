## 🌄 About This Repository

This repository holds the supplementary materials for my talk at CloudX Conference 2024.

- Demo steps and details
- References

## 🛝 About Demo

You can find the Bash based demos in `demo-bash.sh`.

Nushell demo is detailed in `demo-nushell.org`.

### Prerequisites

In order to run through the demo steps for Bash, you will need the following tools:

- `bash`
- `jq`
- `curl`

In order to run through the demo steps for Nushell, you just need Nushell installed.

As the demo is about managing Kubernetes resources, you would want to have Kubernetes cluster running somewhere (simple setup like KinD is sufficient).

### Tools Used

While you may not need all of the tools, the original demo used the following tools:

- Ghostty (Terminal)
- Nix / direnv (Package Management)

### Troubleshooting

If you found any misbehaviour with the setup, please feel free to create an issue. While I'm not intending to maintain with the latest details here, I still check activities and may be able to help.
